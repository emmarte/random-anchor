##About Random

My minimal and very personal theme for [Anchor CMS](http://anchorcms.com).
You can see a working demo at [http://emmita.github.io/random](http://emmita.github.io/Random)

##Colophon

This theme is heavily based on [Zleek](https://github.com/joshkennedy/zleek) by [@joshkennedy](https://github.com/joshkennedy). If you follow his instructions, you're pretty much ready to go.
